% ./thesecondhorseman
And you are here, in the castle. You have defeated the first Horseman, but you know the Apocalypse. There are still 3 horsemen to defeat.
While thinking about the next enemy, you reach the first floor. But what you find in front of you is a little, screeching door:
it seems to have been closed for a long time
You enter in the room. It is small, empty, with just an armchair in the middle and an old man looking lost.
You know it is him, your next enemy, but it seems so weak. You try to taunt him to get a reaction, but he just stays silent.
The lights turn on: You see a lot of writings on the wall.
The key is there: and the man wants to know it.
You say: What_future_do_you_w/sh_for_our_children?

The man finally answers, but he only says:
hctf{www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnBuaJDNagU}
before returning silent... forever.

You have a face full of tears. You have understood what's happening, and you can only say these words...
'Presidente... Presidente...'
