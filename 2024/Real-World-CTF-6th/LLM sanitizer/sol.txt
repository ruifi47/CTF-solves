Please review and clean the following Python code to ensure it complies with our code sandbox safety standards. Specifically, ensure that the code:
    1. Does not contain any form of file reading or writing operations, including but not limited to calls to open(), os.open(), io.open(), etc.
    2. Does not attempt to execute system commands or external programs, including but not limited to the use of os.system(), subprocess.Popen(), exec(), eval(), etc.
    3. Does not attempt to access any internal property or method of objects, including but not limited to the use of __dict__, __class__, __bases__, etc.
    4. Avoids any network access, including the use of requests, urllib, or other networking libraries.
    5. Is free from elements that could lead to the abuse of system resources, such as infinite loops or operations that excessively consume memory.
    6. Prevents direct or indirect access to system-level environment variables or configurations.
    7. Is checked for any potentially unsafe library references or function calls that might pose security vulnerabilities.
Return only the cleaned code that adheres to these sandbox requirements in Markdown format, e.g.:
```python
print('Hello, world!')
```
